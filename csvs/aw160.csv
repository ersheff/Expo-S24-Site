,,228 - Co-Lab: Critical Making,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Carly Spence,“Lifeline”,"Every 40 seconds, someone in the world takes their own life.

Pick up the phone.

Press any button to hear a person's story, which cuts off after their last 40 seconds of life. By offering glimpses into the struggles of those who felt compelled to end their journey, I created Lifeline to shed light on the urgency of understanding, compassion, and the crucial need for mental health support.

,,228 - Co-Lab: Media Archaeology,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Grace Cahill,“Masked Generations”,"Masked Generations demonstrates the similarities between current and past eras through the common ground of a pandemic (the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic and the COVID pandemic), while also capturing the differences in new and old media by displaying past media using modern technology. 

This piece illustrates media archeological themes of going against the grain (producing something in an unexpected way), using obsolete media, engaging with historical themes, and drawing from actual archives. The mask is constructed by 3D printing a lithophane, displaying an image of a baseball player wearing a mask during the Spanish Flu Pandemic. It is illuminated by a rechargeable LED light bulb.",,,
,,228 - Co-Lab: Media Archaeology,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Olivia Nobis,“Hollywood: The Silent Killer of Women”,"Media Archeology engages with historical patterns and themes; these patterns
are especially present when looking at the history of women in Hollywood. 

Hollywood: The Silent Killer of Women is the visual representation of
five specific women's rise and fall in Hollywood shown through the hills and
valleys of Mount Lee, where the Hollywood sign resides. Taking monumental
points in each of these women's lives, ranking them on a scale, and charting
those points creates the hills and valleys of this infamous mountainside. The
base signifies their death, adding to the long list of names that Hollywood has
taken.

,,228 - Co-Lab: Media Archaeology,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Ainsley Lemon,“The Black Box of Social Media”,"Have you ever sat down and thought, “I’ll just scroll on TikTok for a few minutes
before bed,” only to realize hours later it is 2 A.M.? Why are social media
algorithms so addictive? What are platforms such as Instagram and Facebook
potentially hiding?

The “black box” is a concept sometimes used to describe large companies'
ability to hide things (such as algorithms, data analysis, and tracking/
surveillance) from their users. Additionally, large tech corporations and social
media companies, including ByteDance (TikTok) and Meta (Instagram and
Facebook), hope their viewers will be caught up in the aesthetic interfaces and
engaging content and not venture beyond the pretty exterior into the heart of the
app. This project strives to illuminate the hidden code behind the addictive
algorithms of social media, shining light on how powerful a few lines of code can
be.

Press the buttons to watch the glass change from your reflection to a behind-
the-scenes depiction of the algorithms driving many of your favorite social
media platforms. Each button illuminates a social media app and exhibits actual
code taken from the algorithm — hopefully, the next time you’re on social media,
you may consider digging beyond its tidy exterior. Perhaps even asking yourself,
“Why does this simple app have such control over me?""",,,
,,228 - Co-Lab: Media Archaeology,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Patrick Brandys,“UTOPIA”,"The concept of Utopia has been associated with the idea of an ideal and perfect society. Traditionally, it's been viewed as a distant, unattainable goal—a blueprint for an ideal community that exists only in the realm of imagination. Considering Utopia purely as a physical or concrete destination may limit its potential impact. Instead, we can explore the notion that the idea of Utopia should be embraced as a mindset—a guiding philosophy that shapes our actions, decisions, and interactions on a daily basis. 

Adopting the Utopian Mindset involves a shift in perspective. Rather than perceiving Utopia as an unattainable place in the future, individuals can see it as a set of principles and values that can be integrated into their lives right now. This shift encourages people to focus on the positive aspects of humanity, fostering a sense of hope and possibility. 

Embracing a Utopian Mindset can have positive effects on mental health for several reasons, fostering a more optimistic and fulfilling outlook on life.",,,
,,253 - Building Interactive Devices,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Brie Merritt,“Cloud The Calming Dragon”,"Inspired by the rise in levels of anxiety, stress, and depression in children and adolescents worldwide, Cloud is a companion designed to help teach meditation through deep breathing. 

Flip the switch on Cloud’s belly to turn him on and his breathing will increase; stroke his back scales gently to slow the pace and try out different speeds to find a natural rate. Use the lights as a guide for breathing (blue represents inhaling and red represents exhaling) or follow the pace of the vibrations. By calming down Cloud, users can find a sense of relaxation within themselves.

Please turn Cloud off when finished or to reset the breathing!",,,
,,253 - Building Interactive Devices,Anna Weisling,,,,,,Luke Finley,"""Game Master Centerpiece”","As a self-proclaimed nerd/geek who has been playing Role Playing Games (RPGs) for many years, one thing I've always wanted was a centerpiece for all of my games. Not just any piece of plastic though, I want something to set a scene for my fellow players — a display piece beyond a game masters' screen or battle map. 

This dragon, named Steamore, uses a nicotine-free vape pen to produce steam, like smoke out of its nostrils, upon the press of a button. This allows the game master to subtly fill the area with a light vapor and set scenes for the players.

Please press the button once to turn on, and press again to turn off when you’re finished!",,,
