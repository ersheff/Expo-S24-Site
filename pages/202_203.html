  <h3>To Aeris</h3>
  <h4>Gus Kirkpatrick</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    The player starts out as a very small chick, dwarfed by the environment much
    like how a child growing up in our world may feel. As the bird grows, they
    learn to navigate this environment and gain new skills. They give to the
    world around them through mechanics such as pollination, allowing them to
    navigate to new areas and progress, and in turn the world shapes them in
    both mind and appearance. They grow and gain the ability to glide and then
    fly, finding their way in the environment. As new game mechanics are
    introduced, the player is able to navigate the environment more easily and
    in new ways, reflecting the narrative of finding oneself and acclimating to
    a world in the way that through experimentation and experience, a child
    acclimates to adulthood.
