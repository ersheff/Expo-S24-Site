  <h3>Lifeline</h3>
  <h4>Carly Spence</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>Every 40 seconds, someone in the world takes their own life.</p>
  <p>Pick up the phone.</p>
  <p>
    Press any button to hear a person's story, which cuts off after their last
    40 seconds of life. By offering glimpses into the struggles of those who
    felt compelled to end their journey, I created Lifeline to shed light on the
    urgency of understanding, compassion, and the crucial need for mental health
    support.

  <h3>UTOPIA</h3>
  <h4>Patrick Brandys</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    The concept of Utopia has been associated with the idea of an ideal and
    perfect society. Traditionally, it's been viewed as a distant, unattainable
    goal—a blueprint for an ideal community that exists only in the realm of
    imagination. Considering Utopia purely as a physical or concrete destination
    may limit its potential impact. Instead, we can explore the notion that the
    idea of Utopia should be embraced as a mindset—a guiding philosophy that
    shapes our actions, decisions, and interactions on a daily basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adopting the Utopian Mindset involves a shift in perspective. Rather than
    perceiving Utopia as an unattainable place in the future, individuals can
    see it as a set of principles and values that can be integrated into their
    lives right now. This shift encourages people to focus on the positive
    aspects of humanity, fostering a sense of hope and possibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Embracing a Utopian Mindset can have positive effects on mental health for
    several reasons, fostering a more optimistic and fulfilling outlook on life.

  <h3>Masked Generations</h3>
  <h4>Grace Cahill</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    <em>Masked Generations</em> demonstrates the similarities between current
    and past eras through the common ground of a pandemic (the 1918 Spanish Flu
    pandemic and the COVID pandemic), while also capturing the differences in
    new and old media by displaying past media using modern technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    This piece illustrates media archeological themes of going against the grain
    (producing something in an unexpected way), using obsolete media, engaging
    with historical themes, and drawing from actual archives. The mask is
    constructed by 3D printing a lithophane, displaying an image of a baseball
    player wearing a mask during the Spanish Flu Pandemic. It is illuminated by
    a rechargeable LED light bulb.

  <h3>The Black Box of Social Media</h3>
  <h4>Ainsley Lemon</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    Have you ever sat down and thought, "I'll just scroll on TikTok for a few
    minutes before bed," only to realize hours later it is 2 A.M.? Why are
    social media algorithms so addictive? What are platforms such as Instagram
    and Facebook potentially hiding?
  </p>
  <p>
    The “black box” is a concept sometimes used to describe large companies'
    ability to hide things (such as algorithms, data analysis, and tracking/
    surveillance) from their users. Additionally, large tech corporations and
    social media companies, including ByteDance (TikTok) and Meta (Instagram and
    Facebook), hope their viewers will be caught up in the aesthetic interfaces
    and engaging content and not venture beyond the pretty exterior into the
    heart of the app. This project strives to illuminate the hidden code behind
    the addictive algorithms of social media, shining light on how powerful a
    few lines of code can be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Press the buttons to watch the glass change from your reflection to a
    behind- the-scenes depiction of the algorithms driving many of your favorite
    social media platforms. Each button illuminates a social media app and
    exhibits actual code taken from the algorithm — hopefully, the next time
    you're on social media, you may consider digging beyond its tidy exterior.
    Perhaps even asking yourself, “Why does this simple app have such control
    over me?"

  <h3>Hollywood: The Silent Killer of Women</h3>
  <h4>Olivia Nobis</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    Media Archeology engages with historical patterns and themes; these patterns
    are especially present when looking at the history of women in Hollywood.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Hollywood: The Silent Killer of Women</em> is the visual representation
    of five specific women's rise and fall in Hollywood shown through the hills
    and valleys of Mount Lee, where the Hollywood sign resides. Taking
    monumental points in each of these women's lives, ranking them on a scale,
    and charting those points creates the hills and valleys of this infamous
    mountainside. The base signifies their death, adding to the long list of
    names that Hollywood has taken.

  <h3>Game Master Centerpiece</h3>
  <h4>Luke Finley</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    As a self-proclaimed nerd/geek who has been playing Role Playing Games
    (RPGs) for many years, one thing I've always wanted was a centerpiece for
    all of my games. Not just any piece of plastic though, I want something to
    set a scene for my fellow players — a display piece beyond a game masters'
    screen or battle map.
  </p>
  <p>
    This dragon, named Steamore, uses a nicotine-free vape pen to produce steam,
    like smoke out of its nostrils, upon the press of a button. This allows the
    game master to subtly fill the area with a light vapor and set scenes for
    the players.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please press the button once to turn on, and press again to turn off when
    you're finished!

  <h3>Cloud The Calming Dragon</h3>
  <h4>Brie Merritt</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    Inspired by the rise in levels of anxiety, stress, and depression in
    children and adolescents worldwide, Cloud is a companion designed to help
    teach meditation through deep breathing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Flip the switch on Cloud's belly to turn him on and his breathing will
    increase; stroke his back scales gently to slow the pace and try out
    different speeds to find a natural rate. Use the lights as a guide for
    breathing (blue represents inhaling and red represents exhaling) or follow
    the pace of the vibrations. By calming down Cloud, users can find a sense of
    relaxation within themselves.
  </p>
  <p>Please turn Cloud off when finished or to reset the breathing!</p>
