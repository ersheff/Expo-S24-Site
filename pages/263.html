  <h3>Love & Hangover</h3>
  <h4>Brie Merritt</h4>
  <h5>Project Description</h5>
  <p>
    These three canvases are made up of beer cans, beer bottle caps, and wine
    corks found around Oxford, Ohio in alleyways behind restaurants and bars and
    in front of fraternity houses. The two portraits represent Miami
    University's student body and how drinking culture impacts how they are
    portrayed on the outside. In the third canvas, the Miami University logo is
    in the center, surrounded by cans to represent how alcohol impacts the
    campus community. I want my pieces to bring awareness to how drinking can
    affect peoples' behavior and blind them to how their actions negatively
    affect Oxford's environment.
